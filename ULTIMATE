Rules
-----
+ Each player rolls a 20 sided die (yellow) and the sum is the point goal for the game
+ Each player rolls a 12 sided die (green) and the play order goes from highest to lowest---tying players must both re-roll
+ Play a game on your turn and use a die to decide which one
    - with 5 games, roll a 10 sided (B) and choice = abs( 5 - B) with choice 0 being wild



Games
-----

+ Jenga
    - roll MegaDie M = abs( outer - inner )
    - make ceil(M!/2^(M-1)) valid moves and win points = M. You must calculate this by hand.
    - if it falls, lose points = 15 - M
+ Scrabble
    - roll 8 sided (R) and pick that number of tiles
    - make a valid play and win points = 9 - R
    - fail to play and lose points = 2R
+ Smart Ass
    - roll 8 sided (Ra) and have turns = ceil(Ra/2)
    - per turn roll 12 sided (Rb) and card type (CT) = Ceil(Rb/3)
    - Who, What, (when), Where, (why), (how), Hard correspond to CT = 1,2,(),3,(),(),4
    - win points = (2 * Wcards) + (4 * Hcards)
    - Wcards are read by the player to your left and may be stolen by any other players
+ Battle of the Sexes
    - get 4 turns
    - roll 8 sided (R), calculate ceil(R/2), and choose color P,O,Y,G == 1,2,3,4 
    - roll 20 sided and choose sex 1-10 --> M; 11-20 --> F
    - win points = #correct-answer ONLY if #correct-answer > 2
+ Cards
    - pull a card from the deck with value A=1,#=#,J=11,Q=12,K=13
    - roll 12 sided = R
    - IF value = R get R points
    - IF value = 13 have 30sec to say a haiku that makes someone laugh
    - laugh means win points = value, no laugh means lose points = value
